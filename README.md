Overdone Coffee
===============

At Vistar Media, engineers ingress coffee on a near-hourly basis. To combat the
woes of guaranteeing high-quality coffee, we present our humble approach to 
interactive timekeeping for coffee, eggs, and whatever else you can't handle
getting stale.

Soon To Come
============

- microcontroller component for sensing coffee pots
- crossplatform library for coffee timer business logic
- integration with Raspberry Pi and LCD screen to easily share our learnings 
with the world
- integration with Nintendo 2DS using prior I2C and I/O research (submodule 
to come)
